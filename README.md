# filesharing
In cloud solutions like Google's G-Suite and Microsoft OneDrive for Business, teams can work together on documents and talk in real-time.
These apps sync files across everyone's devices, so everyone has the latest version. This is great for teams working on projects together.
But there's a question about how safe the cloud is. Storing data online can expose it to hackers and mistakes made by users. 
Surprisingly, the biggest risk often comes from mistakes made by people inside the company, not external threats. 
They might accidentally share files or give out passwords without knowing.
To keep things safer, we use something called secure file sharing. This way, only the right people can get to the files. 
The files are kept in the cloud, which means any computer viruses won't hurt them. 
We can make it even safer by using two special methods: RSA and AES.
RSA helps with sharing secret codes to open the files. Only the right people can unlock them using their special keys. 
AES is like a lock that only works with a special key, but it's used to keep the files themselves safe.
So, in simple words, cloud tools help us work together, but we need to be careful. 
Secure file sharing with RSA and AES keeps our stuff safe, even if there are mistakes or hackers around.
